## Code Navigation

Use codebase-memory-mcp tools as the primary method for code exploration.

### CMM Tool Decision Table

| Question / Intent | Use |
|-------------------|-----|
| Unfamiliar area / package map | `get_architecture` |
| Find by name (function, class, module) | `search_graph` |
| Source of a specific symbol | `get_code_snippet` |
| Who calls X / what does X call | `trace_call_path` |
| Cross-service or graph-wide queries (Cypher) | `query_graph` |
| Text search in code (string literals, error msgs, TODOs) | `search_code` |

Orient first: `get_architecture` → `search_graph` → `get_code_snippet`. Do not jump straight to reading files.

`Read` is correct for: non-code files (JSON, YAML, config, Markdown), full-file context (imports, globals), files under 50 lines, and files not yet indexed.
